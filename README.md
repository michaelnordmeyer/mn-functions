# mn-functions

Assorted functions to improve my WordPress site w/o plugins. Found on the Internet or taken from other plugins.

Most plugins have only a few lines of code to actually configure or extend WordPress. The majority of the code is plugin setup, maintenance and admin UI. I don' need this as I only configure a plugin once.
