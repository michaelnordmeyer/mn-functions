# mn-functions

Assorted functions to improve my WordPress site w/o plugins. Figured out myself, found on the Internet or taken from other plugins (mentioned or linked in comments).

Most plugins have only a few lines of code to actually configure or extend WordPress. The majority of the code is plugin setup, maintenance and admin UI. I don't need this as I only configure a plugin once.

As all WordPress plugins are licensed GPL2, because they run in the same process space as WordPress does, which in turn is GPL2, these functions are also GPL2.
