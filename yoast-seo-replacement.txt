## Yoast SEO Meta Box while editing a post

General:
	+ Snippet preview: It's a nice touch, but you don't need this. You just have to be aware of the length (150 to 160 charcters) of the meta description or your first paragraph. But most likely every user who uses a search engine will see a custom snippet where the keywords the use searched for are in.
	- Focus keyword
	+ SEO title: Replaces the HTML title tag with this title so you can keep a longer post title while having a reasonable short one for SERP display. Makes only little sense because the SEO title is long enough to "break" your theme anyway, i.e. very long post titles look ugly.
	- Meta description
Page Analysis:
	- Useful information
Advanced:
	+ Options to override default behavior for this particular post. It's very likely you don't need any of those options.
Social:
	+ Title, Description and Image for Facebook, Twitter and Google+: You don't need this, because the standard ones of your post are good enough. It might be handy to cater for different character or display limits.

WordPress User Profile:
	+ Added social profiles: Manually in functions.php of your theme

Posts view in admin:
	- SEO focus keyword indicator
	+ SEO title: see General > Snippet preview
	+ Meta Desc: Use excerpts instead
	- Focus KW:
